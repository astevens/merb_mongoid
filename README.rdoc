= merb_mongoid

A plugin for the Merb framework that provides support for MongoID Models.

== Connection options

Merb MongoID plugin uses config/database.yml for connection configuration.

Options are:

- `host` provide a string or an array of strings to attempt connections with
- `database`

It's more or less than a copy/paste for MongoID of shingara/merb_mongomapper.
